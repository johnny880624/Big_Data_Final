# Big_Data_Final (Flight_Delay_Prediction)|

Hello everyone,    

In this project, our objective is to predict flight arrival times, with the goal of providing valuable insights for both customers and airline companies. By accurately forecasting arrival times, we aim to enhance the travel experience for passengers and improve operational efficiency for airlines. This project involves analyzing various factors that could affect flight schedules, such as weather conditions, airport traffic, and historical performance data. The insights gained from our predictions can assist customers in planning their travel more effectively and enable airlines to optimize their operations and resource allocation. We're excited about the potential impact of this project and look forward to sharing our findings and developments with you.
